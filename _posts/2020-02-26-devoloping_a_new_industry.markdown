The reason why I wanted to learn about Software Develpoment beacuse I wanted to be involved in a industry that lacked women involvement. Of cousre I wanted to learn a new skill and learn to develop software but, my goal is to show light to other women that I as woman can learn to develop software. Also as a creative individual I wanted to put my creative into play by one day introducing new apps and websites.
